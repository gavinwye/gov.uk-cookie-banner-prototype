      <p>Apply for a basic Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) check to get a copy of your criminal record. This is called ‘basic disclosure’. It costs £23. It’s available for people working in England and Wales.</p>

      <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="govuk-inset-text">
        <p>This guide is also available <a href="/gwneud-cais-copi-cofnod-troseddol">in Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <p>You can also get a basic <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check if you live in Northern Ireland or Scotland but the job you’re applying for is in England or Wales.</p>

      <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="govuk-inset-text">
        <p>There’s a different way to apply if you’re applying for a job in <a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/accessni-criminal-record-checks">Northern Ireland</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.mygov.scot/basic-disclosure/apply-for-basic-disclosure/">Scotland</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The check will only show convictions that are not ‘spent’, for example some types of caution will disappear after 3 months.</p>

      <p>You must be 16 or over to apply.</p>

      <p>It usually takes up to 14 days for you to receive your certificate.</p>

      <p>The service is available from 8am to 11:30pm.</p>
